# Visual QA Loop

For UI work, "tests pass" is not the same as "eyes pass."

Third-order stance: static screenshots are receipts, not the whole truth. Look for temporal debt, hidden friction, and trust changes between states: loading, empty, error, hover, focus, permission prompts, and the moment after a user clicks.

## When to Use

- The user asks for visual QA, screenshots, design polish, UI review, hover/focus review, or before/after proof
- A frontend/macOS/iOS UI change might alter layout, copy, color, spacing, or trust perception
- The user wants assurance changes are tweaks, not accidental replacement

## When NOT to Use

- Pure backend or CLI changes with no visual surface
- The app cannot be rendered locally and no screenshot path exists
- The user explicitly says not to do visual validation

<process>

## Phase 1: Pick Stable Targets

Identify the exact pages/windows/states to capture. Prefer the smallest set that covers the changed surface. Include transition states when relevant: loading, empty, error, first-run, disabled, hover/focus, and post-action success/failure.

For web/file targets on this machine, use `chrome-shot` rather than raw Chrome commands:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/dev/agent-notes/<project>/visual-qa/<run>
chrome-shot -o ~/dev/agent-notes/<project>/visual-qa/<run>/home-1440.png http://localhost:3000/
chrome-shot --size 390x1200 -o ~/dev/agent-notes/<project>/visual-qa/<run>/home-mobile.png http://localhost:3000/
```

## Phase 2: Capture Before and After

If changes are not applied yet, capture `before/`. After edits/build, capture `after/` with the same viewport, route, data, and state.

Use filenames that encode route/state/viewport, not verbose captions. If the issue may be motion/jank, capture a short trace, repeated screenshots, or before/after states around the transition rather than only the final settled UI.

## Phase 3: Review Like a User

Check:

- layout shifts, overflow, clipping
- copy drift or confusing labels
- hover/focus/selected states too loud or too invisible
- trust fractures: surprise permissions, privacy creep, pricing ambiguity, destructive actions
- mobile density and tap targets
- empty/error/loading states when relevant
- information density: high-signal details should not disappear behind unnecessary hover/clicks
- temporal debt: flicker, layout shift, stale preview, delayed permission prompt, or post-click ambiguity
- downstream friction: a small visual change near a CTA, filename, price, or destructive action can be larger than its pixel area

## Phase 4: Iterate Once Before Reporting

If an obvious regression is visible, fix it and recapture. Do not hand back known-bad screenshots unless blocked.

## Phase 5: Report Evidence

Return:

- screenshot artifact paths
- what changed visually
- pass/fail verdict
- any remaining concerns
- any "looks fine but may feel wrong over time" temporal/friction concerns

Keep it short. The screenshots are the receipts.

<interlocks>

- Use `trust-audit` when the visual surface touches permissions, privacy, billing, or destructive file changes.
- Use `status-copy-trust-audit` when UI/CLI wording is the confusing part.
- Use `first-contact` when the visual change touches onboarding or day-zero mental models.
- Use `agent-log-forensics` when recurring user complaints point at visual or interaction jank across sessions.
