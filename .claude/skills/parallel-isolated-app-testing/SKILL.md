# Parallel Isolated App Testing

Use this skill to turn “let’s run multiple copies in parallel” from a flaky little chaos goblin into a repeatable testing system.

This skill is for situations like:
- desktop or menu bar apps with local state
- GUI apps where parallel QA would be valuable
- apps that need per-instance defaults, files, fixtures, or logs
- release testing that should split across multiple lanes or agents
- products where naive multi-instance launching would cause collisions, false failures, or state pollution

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- a user wants parallel app testing
- a project needs isolated QA lanes
- multiple agents should exercise different app scenarios concurrently
- an app needs a test mode, fixture mode, or per-instance state roots
- there is a risk of collision across local state or OS integrations

Use it before blindly launching multiple copies of an app that share:
- preferences / `UserDefaults`
- app support or cache directories
- temporary exports or generated files
- watched folders
- notifications
- launch-at-login helpers
- update channels
- permission-dependent UI flows
- singleton / duplicate-instance guards

## Core Principle

Parallel app testing is only useful when failures mean something.

If two instances can silently interfere with each other, the result is not parallel testing. It is a theatrical performance by raccoons.

The goal is to create **isolated, attributable, repeatable test lanes** where each instance has:
- its own state
- its own inputs
- its own logs and artifacts
- a clear scenario assignment
- a clear teardown path

## Quick Start

When asked to set up parallel app testing:

1. Identify all shared-state and side-effect collision surfaces.
2. Decide whether parallel instances are safe at all.
3. If not safe, define the required app test-mode seams.
4. Implement or document the per-instance launch contract.
5. Create a helper launcher that defaults to safe dry-run behavior.
6. Add one or more fixture profiles that land the app in useful states.
7. Split testing into non-colliding lanes.
8. Capture logs, DB state, screenshots, and findings per lane.
9. File follow-up issues for missing seams or blockers.

## Step 1: Decide whether parallel copies make sense

Do not assume that parallel copies are a good idea just because they sound efficient.

First classify the target app:
- **Safe now** — already supports isolated state roots and suppressible side effects
- **Safe with light seams** — needs a small test mode or launcher contract
- **Unsafe for parallel UI** — deep singleton assumptions, shared global mutation, or OS integrations make parallel copies misleading

If unsafe, say so directly and recommend:
- one real UI instance
- plus parallel unit/integration/fake-provider lanes instead

## Step 2: Map collision surfaces

Read the app code and identify all places where multiple instances would interfere.

At minimum inspect:
- preferences storage
- app support / cache / temp paths
- key stores and credentials
- file watchers and monitored folders
- notification delivery
- launch agents / login items / auto-start helpers
- auto-updaters and distribution integrations
- duplicate-instance guards
- first-run / onboarding state
- diagnostics / export output paths
- local databases, lock files, queues, sockets, or named pipes

Use the checklist in [references/collision-checklist.md](references/collision-checklist.md).

Produce a short table:
- collision surface
- current behavior
- risk level
- required isolation or suppression

## Step 3: Define the isolated launch contract

Create a standard per-instance contract.

At minimum, each isolated instance should be able to specify:
- instance ID
- defaults suite name or equivalent
- app state root
- app-support root
- temp root
- screenshot / input fixture root when relevant
- log file path or discoverable log location
- optional fixture profile

Prefer explicit launch arguments and matching environment variables.

A strong contract usually includes flags like:
- `--ui-test-mode`
- `--instance-id <id>`
- `--state-root <path>`
- `--defaults-suite <suite>`
- `--fixture <profile>`

Adjust names to the project, but keep the pattern consistent.

## Step 4: Suppress unsafe side effects in test mode

In isolated test mode, suppress or stub side effects that should not fire during QA.

Typical examples:
- launch-at-login registration
- updater startup
- notification authorization prompts or delivery
- migration helpers that touch shared machine state
- account import from global user secrets
- singleton enforcement that prevents test copies
- analytics or telemetry not needed for local smoke

Do not suppress behavior that the test lane is explicitly trying to verify unless the lane is clearly marked as a stubbed lane.

## Step 5: Add fixture profiles

A parallel-testing system is not complete if every instance lands in useless onboarding.

Add fixture profiles that preseed the minimum state needed for useful test lanes. Use [references/fixture-design.md](references/fixture-design.md) to keep fixtures narrow, deterministic, and documented.

Common profiles:
- `smoke-ready` — bypass onboarding, point to isolated input folder, disable noisy prompts
- `misconfigured-auth` — force auth error state
- `paused` — start in paused mode
- `history-seeded` — preload recent items for History/diagnostics smoke
- `feedback-ready` — support summary and exports can be exercised without first-run blockers
- `fake-provider` — deterministic processing without live network/model dependencies

Document exactly what each fixture seeds and what it does *not* seed.

## Step 6: Create a helper launcher

Always prefer a helper script over expecting humans or agents to hand-type long launch commands. Use [references/launcher-template.md](references/launcher-template.md) as the starting shape.

The helper should:
- default to dry run
- print resolved paths and the exact launch command
- choose the right build or binary
- avoid stale build selection when possible
- support background launch and kill flows
- create required directories
- apply fixture seeding before launch when needed
- write or expose a per-instance log path

A good helper removes 80% of “whoops, wrong build / wrong suite / wrong root” failures.

## Step 7: Split into non-colliding lanes

Assign each lane a distinct purpose.

Good parallel lane splits:
- feedback / diagnostics export lane
- preferences / history / about/help lane
- onboarding / first-run lane
- file-watcher / queue / rename lane
- error-state recovery lane
- trust / permissions lane

For each lane, define:
- instance name
- fixture profile
- input root
- scenario goal
- artifact destinations
- teardown command

Do not let lanes share input folders, DBs, temp roots, or defaults suites.

## Step 8: Validate isolation before trusting results

Before deeper QA, prove that isolation actually works.

At minimum verify:
- multiple instances can launch concurrently
- each instance creates separate state roots
- each instance writes to its own DB/log/temp locations
- watched folders are distinct
- one instance’s actions do not appear in the other’s history or logs
- teardown cleanly removes or stops only the intended instance

If isolation is not proven, stop calling the setup “parallel-safe.”

## Step 9: Run smoke scenarios and collect artifacts

For each lane, collect:
- launch command
- PID or instance identifier
- fixture profile used
- log excerpts
- relevant DB/file evidence
- screenshots if possible
- failures, blockers, and suspected missing seams

If deeper UI automation is blocked by OS permissions, say so explicitly instead of pretending the lane was fully exercised. Use [references/troubleshooting.md](references/troubleshooting.md) to interpret common blockers honestly.

## Step 10: Close the loop

At the end, produce:
- what parallel testing can already verify
- what remains blocked
- which fixture/seam/tooling gaps are next highest leverage
- follow-up issues for each meaningful blocker

Use this format:

## Reusable Patterns

Keep these patterns consistent across projects:

### 1. Isolation contract pattern
- one instance name
- one state root
- one defaults suite
- one fixture profile
- one log file

### 2. Dry-run-first launcher pattern
Never make the default action mutate the machine.
Show the command first. Launch only with an explicit live flag.

### 3. Fixture ladder pattern
Start with `smoke-ready`, then add narrower fixtures only when a real testing need appears.
Do not create a giant omnifixture that tries to represent the entire app.

### 4. Honest blocker reporting pattern
If accessibility, screen capture, backend availability, or another dependency blocks deeper QA, report that as a blocker rather than inventing confidence.

## Concrete Mini Examples

### Example: Menu bar app with watched folders
Needed seams:
- duplicate-instance bypass
- defaults suite override
- app-support override
- temp root override
- watched-folder fixture root
- notification suppression

Likely first fixtures:
- `smoke-ready`
- `fake-provider`
- `feedback-ready`

### Example: Desktop app with export bundles
Needed seams:
- temp/export root override
- stable per-instance logs
- fixture for seeded recent history

Likely parallel lanes:
- exports / diagnostics lane
- history / filters lane
- settings / help lane

## Success Criteria

This work is successful when:
- the app’s parallel-testing safety is stated honestly
- shared-state collisions are mapped, not hand-waved
- isolated launches are easy and repeatable
- at least one useful fixture profile exists
- parallel lanes produce attributable results
- blockers are converted into crisp follow-up work
