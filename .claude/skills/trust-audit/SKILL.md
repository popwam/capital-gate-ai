# Trust Audit

Use this skill to answer the question beneath many launch failures: **“Will a normal user feel safe, respected, and in control?”**

A trust audit is not a security review. It is a perception-and-reality review of the places where users feel:
- watched
- tricked
- over-charged
- surprised by file or data changes
- unsure what the product is really doing
- trapped when something goes wrong

## When to Use

Use this skill when reviewing:
- onboarding or first-run flows
- permission prompts and explanations
- privacy and AI data flows
- billing, credits, trials, renewals, or BYOK setups
- features that rename, move, delete, sync, upload, or otherwise mutate user data
- products where “creepy”, “shady”, or “I don’t trust it” would be fatal

## Core Principle

Trust breaks when there is a mismatch between:
1. **what the user thinks will happen**
2. **what actually happens**
3. **how reversible and well-explained it feels**

Audit both the reality and the vibe. A technically defensible flow can still feel shady.

<process>

## Step 1: Gather the trust surface

Read enough context to map:
- target user
- product promise
- first-run flow
- permissions requested
- what data leaves the device
- what files or records get changed
- billing or credit mechanics
- failure and recovery paths

Then summarize in 5-10 bullets:
- what the user believes they are agreeing to
- what the product actually does
- where a mismatch might exist

## Step 2: Inspect the five trust surfaces

Evaluate each of these explicitly.

### 1. Consent and comprehension
Ask:
- Does the user understand what they are enabling?
- Is important information explained **before** the scary system prompt or pricing moment?
- Is consent meaningful, or buried behind momentum?

### 2. Data and privacy reality
Ask:
- What leaves the machine?
- What is stored, for how long, and by whom?
- Is there any “surprise cloud” moment?
- Would a privacy-sensitive user feel misled if they learned the full data path later?

### 3. File and state safety
Ask:
- Does the product modify user files or important state?
- Could it break organization, aliases, scripts, expectations, or downstream workflows?
- Is there a visible, believable undo or recovery story?

### 4. Billing and fairness
Ask:
- Could a user reasonably feel tricked on price, credits, quotas, renewals, or provider costs?
- Is the distinction between app purchase, subscription, AI usage, and BYOK painfully clear?
- Would a user say “wait, I thought this was included”?

### 5. Degraded-mode honesty
Ask:
- When the product is partially broken, does it look healthy anyway?
- Does the user understand whether it is paused, misconfigured, rate-limited, offline, blocked, or waiting?
- Could the product silently fail in a way that makes the user blame themselves?

## Step 3: Generate trust failures

Produce 6-12 concrete trust risks. For each, include:
- **Trust failure** — one sentence
- **What the user expected**
- **What actually happens**
- **Why it feels bad** — creepy, deceptive, careless, destructive, unfair, etc.
- **Likely reaction** — support email, uninstall, refund, bad review, internal IT rejection, etc.
- **Severity** — low/medium/high
- **Trust fracture type** — consent / privacy / pricing / file safety / silent failure / recovery
- **Repair move** — the most direct product or copy change

## Step 4: Distinguish vibes from actual danger

Split findings into:
- **Trust theater** — looks scary but is mostly messaging / framing
- **Real trust hazard** — real risk, real surprise, or real damage

Do not flatten them together.

## Step 5: Present the audit

Use this format:

```markdown
# Trust Audit: [Product / Feature]

## Executive Read
- Biggest trust risk:
- Most likely “creepy” interpretation:
- Most likely “I got tricked” interpretation:
- Most dangerous file/data surprise:

## Trust Surface Map

- Data flow:
- File/state mutation:
- Billing:
- Degraded-mode honesty:

## Success Criteria

The audit is complete when it identifies:
- what the user thinks is happening
- where that belief is wrong or incomplete
- which mismatch will feel worst
- which fix most increases user trust fastest
